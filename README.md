# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning
A prediction model that can predict whether are you prone to any heart disease or not
This Predictor is based on a Classification Model whose dataset is centered on cleveland.csv containing about 303 patients data including both the kinds, cardiac and non-cardiac patients. This model is created using Support Vector Machine Classifier which upon evalulation gave 90% accuracy on test set.


## Vision:
"Heart diseases are the major cause for human mortality rate. Correct diagnosis and treatment at an early stage will save people from heart disease and will decrease mortality rate due to heart problem." - [As quoted by S.Chellammal and R. Sharmila in "Recommendation of Attributes for Heart Disease Prediction using Correlation Measure" International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering (IJRTE) ISSN: 2277-3878, Volume-8, Issue-2S3, July 2019]

This highly inspired me to design a state of art technology that helps eradicate the various misconceptions of having to believe every illness would result in a deadly disease.

Itâ€™s become a trend to end up checking your Health status over internet which only ends up giving you false results and unnecessary stress.

With this predictor, we are looking forward to helping out people rule out their doubts regarding heart diseases which is backed by strong data base which promises to not stress you out.
